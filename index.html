                    <p>
                        Hot flashes wake you at night. Sleep becomes elusive. Your body feels unfamiliar as weight 
                        shifts and energy fades. These aren't just minor inconveniences - they impact your work, 
                        relationships, and daily well-being. You've tried the usual advice, but nothing seems to 
                        provide lasting relief.

                    <p>
                        Beyond the physical changes, you're navigating questions of identity and self-image. 
                        Mood swings feel unpredictable. The woman you see in the mirror doesn't match who you 
                        feel inside. You wonder: "Who am I becoming?" This transition touches not just your 
                        body, but your sense of self and life purpose.

                    <p>
                        You've heard it too many times: "Just get through it." But you deserve more than dismissal. 
                        Finding a doctor who truly listens, who understands menopause as more than a checklist of 
                        symptoms, feels impossible. You need support that addresses the complete you - body, mind, 
                        and life direction.

                <p>

                    understanding of the psychological and existential dimensions of this journey. You're not 
                    just a patient - you're a partner in creating your path forward.

                        Our practice philosophy centers on comprehensive care that addresses the complete person. 
                        Menopause treatment requires more than symptom management - it demands an understanding 
                        of the physical, psychological, and existential dimensions of this life transition. Through 
                        evidence-based medical approaches combined with individualized support, we create treatment

                    <h3>How long does treatment typically take?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Treatment duration varies based on individual needs and chosen program. Our Program 1 
                        "Breathe a Sigh of Relief" involves 3 appointments over 6-8 weeks for initial symptom 
                        relief. Program 2 extends to 6-8 appointments over 3-4 months for comprehensive support. 
                        Program 3 is a complete 6-month transformational journey with 9+ appointments. Many patients 
                        begin experiencing improvements within the first few weeks of starting treatment.

                <div class="faq-card">
                    <h3>Is hormone therapy safe?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Bioidentical hormone therapy, when properly prescribed and monitored, is a safe and 
                        effective treatment for menopause symptoms. We conduct thorough health assessments, 
                        review your complete medical history, and perform necessary testing before recommending 
                        hormone therapy. Treatment is carefully individualized to your specific needs, and we 
                        provide ongoing monitoring to ensure safety and effectiveness. All treatment options are 
                        fully explained so you can make informed decisions.

                <div class="faq-card">
                    <h3>What if I'm not sure which program is right for me?</h3>
                    <p>
                        That's completely normal, and you're not expected to decide alone. During your initial 
                        consultation, we'll discuss your symptoms, concerns, goals, and life situation. Together, 
                        we'll determine which program best matches your needs. You can also start with Program 1 
                        and transition to more comprehensive support if desired. Our approach is flexible and 
                        centered on your unique journey.

                    <h3>Do you accept insurance?</h3>
                    <p>
                        As a private practice (Privatpraxis), we primarily work with privately insured patients. 
                        Private health insurance typically covers 75-90% of treatment costs. We provide detailed 
                        invoices that you can submit to your insurance provider. For patients with statutory 
                        insurance (gesetzliche Krankenversicherung), treatment costs are generally paid privately, 
                        though some services may be partially reimbursable depending on your supplementary insurance.

                    <h3>How is this different from regular gynecological care?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Our approach recognizes menopause as a complete life transition, not just a collection 
                        of symptoms to manage. While traditional gynecological care often focuses on brief 
                        symptom-focused consultations, we provide extended appointment times, integrate psychological 
                        support, address lifestyle factors, and create structured journey-based programs. You receive 
                        comprehensive care that addresses your body, mind, and life direction - not just prescriptions 
                        in 15-minute appointments.

                <div class="faq-card">
                    <h3>What can I expect in my first appointment?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Your initial consultation is an extended appointment (typically 60-90 minutes) where we 
                        take time to understand your complete story. We'll discuss your symptoms, medical history, 
                        life situation, concerns, and goals. This may include a physical examination and discussion 
                        of necessary diagnostic tests. Most importantly, you'll have time to ask questions and 
                        begin to understand your treatment options. You'll leave with a clear understanding of 
                        your next steps and recommended approach.

                    <h3>Are appointments available outside regular business hours?</h3>
                    <p>
                        We understand the demands on your time. While our primary practice hours are during the 
                        workweek, we do offer some flexibility with early morning and late afternoon appointments. 
                        Please discuss your scheduling needs when booking your appointment, and we'll do our best 
                        to accommodate your situation. Our goal is to make quality care accessible within the 
                        constraints of your busy life.
