                        just physical symptoms. It's for those who want to address the deeper questions
                        that arise during this transition - questions about identity, purpose, intimacy,
                        and the path forward.

                        growth and renewal, this comprehensive program provides the support you need.

                        while also providing psychological support, nutritional guidance, and lifestyle
                        counseling. This is about helping you rediscover yourself and step into this
                        new phase of life with strength and clarity.

                        All programs are eligible for private health insurance reimbursement in Germany.
                        Coverage rates typically range from 75-90% depending on your specific plan
                        and the services included in your program.

                    <p>
                        Laboratory tests are billed separately based on the laboratory's actual costs.
                        These are generally almost entirely covered by private health insurance. You'll
                        receive detailed cost estimates before any testing is performed.

                        before payment. After we determine the right approach for you, you'll receive
                        a PayPal.me link for convenient payment.

                        examinations and initial consultations are better done in person. We'll create a
